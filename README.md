# Genesys Multicloud CX Private Edition - Quickstart on GCP

The purpose of this repository is to provide pretested sample platform reference architectures for deploying Genesys Multicloud CX Private Edition containers and Helm charts to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).  The content provided in this repository can not be used for QA or Production environments as it is not designed to meet typical HA, DR, multi-region or Security requirements.  All content is being provided AS-IS without any SLA, warranty or coverage via Genesys product support.

This project is derived from the following two repositories maintained by Genesys Product:
* [MultiCloud Platform](https://github.com/genesys/multicloud-platform)
* [MultiCloud Services](https://github.com/genesys/multicloud-services)

## Repository Structure

This repository is broken up into two sections:
* Platform - Contains Terraform files to provision a new GCP project with the necessary Google API's and services. 
* Services - Contains the Helm Charts to provision the Private Edition containers.
